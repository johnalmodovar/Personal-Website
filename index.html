            My name is John Almodovar.
            <br />
            I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for technology.

          <h2 class="display-4">About Me</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Based in Los Angeles, California — I pursued a marketing degree in
            Mt. San Antonio College while working in the food industry with 10
            years of experience in multiple managerial positions before
            transitioning into software engineering.

          <p class="lead">
            A close friend encouraged me to make the switch into software
            engineering because he believed I had the talent and determination
            to succeed in this field and have an inherent passion for
            computers. I decided to give his idea a try by studying JavaScript
            and the basics of coding — the more I immersed myself into the
            fundamentals of coding, the more I realized this is the career I
            truly wanted to pursue.

          <p class="lead">
            Throughout the years of my tenure in the food industry, I have held
            a managerial position throughout my jobs, where I refined and
            developed my skillets to successfully lead my teams to complete
            their tasks with efficiency and poise. These skillsets included:

          <ul class="lead">
            <li>
              Team Leadership: guiding and motivating team members to achieve
              efficiency and a positive work environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Operational Management: overseeing daily operations to ensure
              efficiency and addressing issues that occur.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communication: transparancy, actively listening to team members
              and providing feedback to others while being open to receiving
              feedbacks.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead">
            My goals for the future are to become a full stack engineer and work
            for companies to create innovate apps, websites, and other
            cutting-edge projects.
          <p class="lead">
            In my spare time, I love to watch anime, play video games with
            friends, and hang out with my cat.
